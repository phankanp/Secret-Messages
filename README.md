## Secret Messages
Take a few of the famous ciphers listed here and implement them in Python so you can quickly encode and decode secret messages. Each cipher should be created as a Python class and each must expose two methods: encrypt and decrypt. Each of these methods should take a single string to be encoded or decoded and should return the properly encoded or decoded version of the string according to the cipher.
